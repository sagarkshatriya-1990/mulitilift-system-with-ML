🚀 Smart Lift System using ESP32, Python & OpenCVA prototype of an intelligent crowd-aware elevator system using ESP32, Arduino C, Python, and OpenCV. The lift moves to the floor with the highest crowd detected via live camera feed and automatically returns after servicing the request.---📌 Features🧠 Crowd Detection using OpenCV and Haar cascade.🔁 Lift movement logic controlled via ESP32 and DC gear motor.📡 Wi-Fi communication between Python (OpenCV) and ESP32 via HTTP.🔦 LED indicators for each floor.🧲 Reed switch-based floor detection.🌐 Web server hosted on ESP32 to receive crowd data.---🛠️ Components UsedHardwareESP32DC Gear MotorL298N Motor Driver3 Reed Switches (one per floor)3 LEDsMagnets (for reed switch activation)Power SupplyJumper wires, breadboard, lift prototype setupSoftwareArduino IDE (for ESP32 code)Python 3OpenCV (`cv2`)`requests` library (for HTTP)Haarcascade model (for face detection)---📁 File StructureSmart-Lift-System/├── ArduinoCode.txt # ESP32 code (Arduino C)├── crowd.py # Python script for crowd detection├── model/│ └── haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml├── README.md # Project documentationmarkdown---🔧 Setup Instructions1. Upload ESP32 CodeOpen `ArduinoCode.txt` in Arduino IDE.Install `ESP32` board packages via Board Manager.Connect your ESP32 and upload the code.Update the Wi-Fi credentials (`ssid` and `password`).Note the IP address printed in Serial Monitor.2. Configure Python ScriptEnsure webcam is working.Place `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` inside `model/` folder.Update `esp_ip` in `crowd.py` with your ESP32 IP.Set correct floor number for each Python instance (0, 1, or 2).Install required libraries:pip install opencv-python requestsRun the script:python crowd.py3. Working MechanismEach laptop runs crowd.py and detects the number of faces.If crowd ≥ 2, it sends HTTP request to ESP32 like:arduinohttp://<ESP32_IP>/floor0?count=3ESP32 receives requests for all floors and chooses the one with the highest crowd.Lift moves to that floor using a DC motor and stops via reed switches.After servicing, it returns to ground floor (floor 0).
